title: SOS
sentence: |
  For you, I'll sing this song
  Please stay, it won't last song
  Years after we are long gone
  The meaning will stay strong
  Silence is what this song's about
  Numb to the world all around
  But I will sing of this place
  Hoping it finds you some way
  People needing to be saved
  Scream out for help every day
  But we grow numb to the sounds
  And feelings slowly start to drown
  The first time, we can hear a voice
  But soon it all becomes noise
  Fading to silence in the end
  I know it doesn't make sense
  When sound all ceases to exist
  People think that means happiness
  And all the sounds that used to be
  Are all just noise to you and me
  The cries of help disappear
  The silence numbs all of our ears
