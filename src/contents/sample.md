title: Sample
sentence: |
  She put the pen to paper 
  but she couldn't bring herself to actually write anything. 
  
  She just stared at the blank card and wondered 
  what words she could write that would help in even a small way. 
  
  She thought of a dozen ways to begin but none seemed to do justice to the situation. 
  
  There were no words that could help and she knew it.
